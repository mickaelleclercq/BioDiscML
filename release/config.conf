# IMPORTANT: for classification, do not use classes with numeric attributes. Else,

#####################
### BASIC OPTIONS ###
#####################

## Working directory. If local execution, don't set it.
# Default: wd=*empty* (local directory)

#wd=working_directory


## Project name, used as prefix for outfiles.
# Default: project=myProject

project=myProject


## Type of classification: Classification
# Set to true if we perform a classification (nominal class). 
# Default: doClassification=false

doClassification=false

# If true, set the column class name to classify.
# Default: classificationClassName=class

classificationClassName=class


## Type of classification: Regression
# Set to true if we perform a regression (numeric class). 
# Default:doRegression=false
doRegression=false

# If true, set the column class name to classify.
# Default: regressionClassName=class

regressionClassName=class


## Training input files
# Set infiles here if you have several dataset with a common ID column that will
# be used for merging. Only IDs existing in all files will be kept for training, 
# those missing in one of the file will be ignored.
# All decimal separated values commas (,) will be changed to dots (.).
# You also must remove special symbols within your data (e.g.: %/\*"':éèà).
# usage: trainFile=filename_in_working_directory,description 
# The description will be used as a prefix for features of the file to avoid  
# duplicated names. It can be left empty if there is no risk of duplicated names.
# (ex:  trainFile=myproteinsfile, protein
#       trainFile=mygenesfile, genes
#       trainFile=mymetadatafile).
# Default: trainFile=*empty*

trainFile=trainFile1.csv, description
trainFile=trainFile2.csv


## Merging 
# Merging identifier, used if you have many files to merge. It is expected to be
# found in the first column of every files.
# Only rows containing identifiers that exist in all files will be considered in 
# the analysis.
# Default: mergingID=*empty*

#mergingID=identifier


## Sampling
# Perform sampling to create a random test set not used during training and
# used for further evaluation. 
# Default: sampling=true

sampling=true

# The samplingFold option separate the set in x parts, keep 1 for test, others 
# for training.
# e.g. samplingFold=3 means that the test set will be composed of 1/3 of the 
# input data.
# Ignored if sampling=false
# Default: samplingFold=3

samplingFold=3

# Instead of random sampling, you can provide a test file on which the models 
# will be tested. 
# Note that the test file must contain the same structure and features as the 
# train file.
# You can also provide several test files, they will be merged.
# If set, samplingFold options will be ignored. 
# Ignored if sampling=false
# Default: testSamplingFile=*empty*

#testSamplingFile=testFile1.csv


## Feature exclusion
# Features to exclude from the dataset (separated by commas(,)).
# Do not exclude the identifier (usually the first column).
# Default: excluded=*empty*

#excluded=columnA,columnB


## Best model auto-selection 
# A specified number of models will be generated here, along with various performance 
# metrics and correlated features for each one. Choose how many best models to 
# generate and the metric on which the models will be sorted.
# Instead of a specific number of models, a threshold can also be set.
# Models will be selected based on both numberOfBestModels and 
# numberOfBestModelsSortingMetricThreshold conditions
# Metrics can be any column of the results file: 
# 	We prefer those for classification: TEST_MCC, TEST_BER, TRAIN_TEST_BS_MCC, 
#                                           TRAIN_TEST_BS_BER, AVG_BER, AVG_MCC 
# 	We prefer those for regression: TEST_CC, TEST_RMSE, TRAIN_TEST_BS_CC, 
#                                       TRAIN_TEST_BS_RMSE, AVG_RMSE, AVG_CC 
# Examples: AVG_MCC at 0.6, AVG_RMSE at 0.3, AVG_CC at 0.8
# See commands in readme.txt to extract specific models
# Default: numberOfBestModels=1 
#    numberOfBestModelsSortingMetric=AVG_MCC
#    numberOfBestModelsSortingMetricThreshold=0.6

numberOfBestModels=1
numberOfBestModelsSortingMetric=AVG_MCC
numberOfBestModelsSortingMetricThreshold=0.6


## Combine models
# If true, only one model will be computed using a combination of all models 
# selected with best models options. 
# Combination rules: 
# 	AVG (Average of probabilities)
#	PROD (Product of probabilities)
#	MAJ (Majority voting)
#	MED (Median)
# Default: combineModels=false
#   combinationRule=AVG

combineModels=false
combinationRule=AVG

### ADVANCED OPTIONS ###

## Debug to show more outputs
# Default: debug=false

debug=false


## Maximum number of cpus to use (enter a value or "max").
# BioDiscML runs in low priority by regularly checking cpus available. So
# you can execute other softwares on your server and it will adapt itself. 
# Just be careful to available memory, limit number of cpus used to avoid out 
# of memory exception. 
# Default: cpus=max

cpus=max


## The separator (delimiter) of infiles will be detected automatically. 
# It is however possible to set it, but it must exist for all files.
# Default: separator=*empty*

## Criterion (metrics) optimizers
# To test if a model generated with a feature subset is better with another 
# subset, we use various criterions as comparison metrics. 
# You can limit the list of criterions if wanted.

# 	kappa, AUPRC, Fscore, Precision, Recall, TP+FN

## RUN mode
# BioDiscML will test all available classifier algorithms. If you wish to choose
# specific classifiers, you'll need to use the fast way mode and provide a 
# list of classifiers configurations (classifier name and hyperparameters). 
# Please use Weka GUI to help you choose the configurations
# For each configuration, you'll need to provide what optimizer to use.
#
# Fast mode classification:
# Usage: cfcmd=classifier with options,optimizer.
# Available optimizers: AUC, ACC, SEN, SPE, MCC, TP+FN, kappa.
# If no optimizer is provided, they will all be tested
# Default: classificationFastWay=false
#   ccmd=*empty*
